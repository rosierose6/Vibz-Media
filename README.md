Vibz Media is a programmatic AI video engine built on [Remotion](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion) that combines 40+ open source repositories into a single creation pipeline. Voice cloning (GPT-SoVITS), talking-head avatars (MuseTalk / LatentSync), word-accurate animated captions (WhisperX), text-to-video generation (Wan 2.2 / LTX-Video), music generation (ACE-Step), background removal, image editing (Sharp), vector graphics (SVG.js), drag-and-drop editor, video timeline, 100+ GPU-accelerated transitions, and motion graphics — all running locally.

It replaces everything in the [Remotion Pro Store](https://www.remotion.pro/store) — Editor ($600), Animated Captions ($100), Timeline ($300), Cube Transition ($10), Colors & Shapes ($20), Watercolor Map ($50) — and most of the Adobe Creative Cloud suite. **$1,080+ in paid features and $190+/mo in subscriptions, free.**

No API keys. No subscriptions. No per-video charges. You own the entire stack.

**Every integration is audited for commercial-safe licensing** (Apache-2.0 / MIT / BSD) — so what you build on Vanta, you can actually sell. See [ENHANCEMENTS.md](ENHANCEMENTS.md) for the full verified audit + what's coming next.

### Voice Cloning — GPT-SoVITS & OpenVoice

**What it does:** Give it 60 seconds of anyone's voice. It creates a clone that can say anything you type, in real-time, in any language.

**How it works:** GPT-SoVITS (54K+ stars) uses a two-stage pipeline. First, it extracts speaker embeddings from your audio sample — pitch contour, timbre, speaking rhythm, breathing patterns. Then it feeds your text through a VITS (Variational Inference Text-to-Speech) model conditioned on those embeddings. The result is natural speech that sounds like the original speaker, not a robotic TTS voice.

OpenVoice (35K+ stars) takes a different approach with instant voice transfer. Instead of training on a sample, it decouples style (tone, emotion, accent) from content, letting you transfer voice characteristics in a single forward pass. This means zero training time — upload a sample, get a clone instantly.

**How it connects to Vanta:** The `voice-clone.ts` integration runs a local GPT-SoVITS or OpenVoice server. You call `cloneVoice()` with a WAV sample, then `voice.speak("your text")` returns an audio URL. Drop that URL into Remotion's `<Audio>` component and your video has a cloned voiceover.

```typescript
import { cloneVoice } from "./integrations/voice-clone";

const voice = await cloneVoice({
  serverUrl: "http://localhost:9880",
  sampleAudioPath: "./my-voice.wav",
});
const audioUrl = await voice.speak("Welcome to the future of video.");
// <Audio src={audioUrl} /> in your Remotion composition
```

**What it replaces:** ElevenLabs ($5/mo for 30 min), PlayHT ($31.20/mo), Murf ($26/mo)

**Repos:**
- [GPT-SoVITS](https://github.com/RVC-Boss/GPT-SoVITS) — 60,100+ stars, MIT, ships `api_v2.py` HTTP server
- [VoxCPM](https://github.com/OpenBMB/VoxCPM) — 34,200+ stars, Apache-2.0, OpenAI-compatible REST API, 30 languages
- [Chatterbox](https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox) — 25,700+ stars, MIT, emotion exaggeration control
- [F5-TTS](https://github.com/SWivid/F5-TTS) — 15,000+ stars, MIT, clones from a 10-second reference
- [kokoro-js](https://github.com/hexgrad/kokoro) — Apache-2.0, pure-TypeScript ONNX TTS (zero Python, runs in-process)
- [OpenVoice](https://github.com/myshell-ai/OpenVoice) — 37,000+ stars, MIT

### AI Avatars — MuseTalk, LatentSync, InfiniteTalk

**What it does:** One headshot photo becomes a talking presenter. Upload a photo, feed it audio, and get a video of that person speaking with natural head movements and perfect lip sync. Or take any existing video and re-dub it with new audio — the lips will match.

**How it works:** MuseTalk (6.2K+ stars, MIT, from Tencent Music) does real-time lip-sync at 30fps+ — feed it a face video and new audio, and it regenerates the mouth region frame-by-frame in latent space so the lips match the new track. It's the modern replacement for the abandoned Wav2Lip line.

LatentSync (5.9K+ stars, Apache-2.0, from ByteDance) is the quality pick: an audio-conditioned latent diffusion model that generates temporally consistent lip sync directly on existing footage — no intermediate 3D representation, no flicker.

InfiniteTalk (7.5K+ stars, Apache-2.0) generates **unlimited-length** talking video from a single image plus audio — full head movement, expressions, and identity consistency across minutes of footage, not seconds. EchoMimicV3 (Apache-2.0) extends this to full-body and half-body animation on just 12GB VRAM.

**License note:** Vanta previously referenced SadTalker (abandoned 2024), Wav2Lip (non-commercial — README prohibits commercial use), and V-Express (research-only checkpoints). All replaced with the commercial-safe stack above. See [ENHANCEMENTS.md](ENHANCEMENTS.md) for the full audit.

**How it connects to Vanta:** The `ai-avatar.ts` integration sends your headshot and audio to a local MuseTalk or LatentSync server. It returns a video URL that you use with Remotion's `<OffthreadVideo>` component. The avatar video composites directly into your scene layout.

```typescript
import { createAvatar } from "./integrations/ai-avatar";

const avatar = await createAvatar({
  serverUrl: "http://localhost:8080",
  imagePath: "./headshot.jpg",
});
const videoUrl = await avatar.speak("./voiceover.wav");
// <OffthreadVideo src={videoUrl} /> in your composition
```

**What it replaces:** Synthesia ($22/mo, $30/video for custom avatars), HeyGen ($48/mo), D-ID ($5.90/min)

**Repos:**
- [MuseTalk](https://github.com/TMElyralab/MuseTalk) — 6,200+ stars, MIT, real-time 30fps lip sync
- [LatentSync](https://github.com/bytedance/LatentSync) — 5,900+ stars, Apache-2.0, SOTA diffusion lip sync
- [InfiniteTalk](https://github.com/MeiGen-AI/InfiniteTalk) — 7,500+ stars, Apache-2.0, unlimited-length talking video
- [EchoMimicV3](https://github.com/antgroup/echomimic_v3) — Apache-2.0, full-body animation on 12GB VRAM
- [ditto-talkinghead](https://github.com/antgroup/ditto-talkinghead) — Apache-2.0, real-time streaming (ONNX + TensorRT)

### Auto-Captions — WhisperX + Remotion

**What it does:** Drop in any audio file. Get word-level timestamps with timing accurate to the millisecond. Render them as animated captions in your video — TikTok-style word highlights, karaoke scrolls, whatever you want.

**How it works:** WhisperX (23K+ stars, BSD-2) runs OpenAI's Whisper model locally, then adds the step raw Whisper skips: **wav2vec2 forced phoneme alignment**. Plain Whisper interpolates word timings and drifts; WhisperX aligns every word against the actual audio waveform — not just "this sentence starts at 2.3s" but "the word 'future' starts at 2.31s and ends at 2.58s." It also runs 70x realtime with batching and includes speaker diarization free. This precision is what makes animated captions possible.

The transcription feeds into Remotion's rendering system where each word becomes a React component positioned in the timeline. You can style them however you want — scale, color, position, animation — because they're just React elements with frame-accurate timing.

**How it connects to Vanta:** The `auto-captions.ts` integration sends audio to a local Whisper server and returns an array of `CaptionWord` objects with `start`, `end`, and `confidence` values. Map over these in a Remotion `<Sequence>` and you have animated captions.

```typescript
import { transcribe } from "./integrations/auto-captions";

const captions = await transcribe("./audio.wav", { model: "large" });
// Returns: [{ word: "Hello", start: 0.0, end: 0.5, confidence: 0.98 }, ...]
// Map over these in a Remotion Sequence for animated captions
```

**What it replaces:** Descript ($24/mo), Rev.ai ($0.02/min), manual SRT editing

**Repos:**
- [WhisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX) — 23,000+ stars, BSD-2, forced-alignment word timestamps + diarization
- [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) — 24,500+ stars, MIT, 4x faster CTranslate2 engine
- [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp) — 52,000+ stars, MIT, CPU/Metal inference with zero Python
- [sherpa-onnx](https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx) — 13,800+ stars, Apache-2.0, native Node.js bindings (no Python sidecar)
- [@remotion/captions](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/captions) — Official Remotion captions

### AI Video Generation — Wan 2.2, LTX-Video & FramePack

**What it does:** Type a text prompt. Get a video clip. "Aerial shot of a city at sunset, cinematic lighting" becomes actual footage you can use as B-roll in your production. Or feed it a still image and get it animated.

**How it works:** Wan 2.2 (16.8K+ stars, **Apache-2.0 code AND weights** — the only SOTA-tier video model that's fully permissive) uses a Mixture-of-Experts Diffusion Transformer for text-to-video and image-to-video. The TI2V-5B variant runs on a single RTX 4090. This is the quality tier that used to require Runway or Kling subscriptions.

LTX-Video (10.7K+ stars, from Lightricks) is the speed pick — **real-time-class generation**, faster than playback on datacenter GPUs, with a distilled 2B model for consumer cards. Speed matters inside an editor: generate B-roll while you're still editing, not overnight.

FramePack (17K+ stars, Apache-2.0, from the ControlNet author) generates long image-to-video on just **6GB VRAM** using next-frame-section prediction — the consumer-hardware king.

**How it connects to Vanta:** The `ai-video.ts` integration talks to a local generation server (ComfyUI runs all three models behind one HTTP API on `:8188`). `generateVideo()` takes a text prompt and returns a clip URL. `animateImage()` takes a still image and motion description and returns an animated version. Both feed directly into Remotion's `<OffthreadVideo>`.

```typescript
import { generateVideo, animateImage } from "./integrations/ai-video";

// Generate B-roll from text
const clip = await generateVideo("A sunset over the ocean, cinematic 4K", {
  serverUrl: "http://localhost:7860",
});

// Animate a still image
const animated = await animateImage("./product.png", "slow zoom with particles", {
  serverUrl: "http://localhost:7860",
});
```

**What it replaces:** Runway ML ($12/mo), Pika Labs ($8/mo), stock footage libraries ($15-$300/clip)

**Repos:**
- [Wan 2.2](https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.2) — 16,800+ stars, Apache-2.0 code + weights, SOTA open video model
- [LTX-Video](https://github.com/Lightricks/LTX-Video) — 10,700+ stars, real-time-class generation
- [FramePack](https://github.com/lllyasviel/FramePack) — 17,100+ stars, Apache-2.0, long video on 6GB VRAM
- [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) — 122,000+ stars, one localhost API serving all of the above
- [Open-Sora](https://github.com/hpcaitech/Open-Sora) — legacy fallback

### AI Music — ACE-Step

**What it does:** Describe the music you want. "Upbeat lo-fi hip hop with soft piano and vinyl crackle, 90 BPM." Get a fully produced track, royalty-free, unlimited generations.

**How it works:** ACE-Step 1.5 (11.8K+ stars, MIT) is a local Suno alternative — the official repo, actively developed. It understands genre, tempo, mood, and instrumentation from text descriptions, trains custom LoRAs, and runs on CUDA, Apple Silicon (MLX), AMD, and Intel. Unlike Suno or Udio which run in the cloud and charge per generation, ACE-Step runs on your hardware — and it ships a **first-party REST API**: `uv run acestep-api` gives you `http://localhost:8001` out of the box.

MMAudio (2.2K+ stars, MIT including weights) fills the other half of the audio story: **video-to-audio foley**. Feed it a video clip and optional text, and it generates synchronized sound effects — footsteps, doors, ambience — matched to what's happening on screen. YuE (6.3K+ stars, Apache-2.0) adds full-song generation with vocals and lyrics.

**How it connects to Vanta:** The `ai-music.ts` integration sends a text prompt to the local ACE-Step server and returns a track URL with BPM metadata. Drop it into Remotion's `<Audio>` component for a custom soundtrack on every video.

```typescript
import { generateMusic } from "./integrations/ai-music";

const track = await generateMusic("cinematic orchestral tension building", {
  serverUrl: "http://localhost:8000",
});
// <Audio src={track.url} /> — custom soundtrack for your video
```

**What it replaces:** Suno ($8/mo), Udio ($10/mo), Epidemic Sound ($15/mo), stock music ($15-$50/track)

**Repos:**
- [ACE-Step-1.5](https://github.com/ace-step/ACE-Step-1.5) — 11,800+ stars, MIT, official repo with built-in REST API
- [MMAudio](https://github.com/hkchengrex/MMAudio) — 2,200+ stars, MIT, video-to-audio foley generation
- [YuE](https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/YuE) — 6,300+ stars, Apache-2.0, full songs with vocals + lyrics

---

### Background Removal — imgly

**What it does:** Remove backgrounds from photos and video frames in the browser. No server, no API calls, no upload. Runs entirely client-side using WebAssembly.

**How it works:** imgly's background-removal-js (6.9K+ stars) uses a U2-Net segmentation model compiled to ONNX and executed via ONNX Runtime Web. The model identifies foreground subjects (people, objects) at the pixel level and produces an alpha matte. Because it runs in WebAssembly, there's no server round-trip — a 1080p image processes in about 2 seconds on a modern browser.

This is the same technology powering the background removal in apps like Canva and Remove.bg, except it's running locally in your pipeline with no usage limits.

**How it connects to Vanta:** The `background-removal.ts` integration wraps imgly's library. Call `removeBackground()` with an image and get back a transparent PNG as an object URL. Use it as an `<Img>` source in Remotion to composite subjects over any background — generated scenes, gradients, video footage.

```typescript
import { removeBackground } from "./integrations/background-removal";

const result = await removeBackground("./presenter-photo.jpg");
// result.url is a transparent PNG — composite over any background
// <Img src={result.url} /> layered over your Remotion scene
```

**What it replaces:** Remove.bg ($0.20/image), Canva Pro background remover, manual Photoshop masking

**Repos:**
- [background-removal-js](https://github.com/imgly/background-removal-js) — 6,900+ stars, client-side

---

### Video Editor — DesignCombo + Twick

**What it does:** A full CapCut/Canva-style drag-and-drop video editor built on Remotion. Timeline, layers, effects, font picker, asset uploads — the complete editing experience. Non-coders get a visual interface. Developers get 80+ feature flags to customize everything.

**How it works:** DesignCombo's react-video-editor (1.4K+ stars) is built ON TOP of Remotion's rendering engine. Every edit in the visual UI maps to Remotion compositions under the hood. The editor serializes your timeline into JSON that Remotion renders to MP4. This means anything created visually can also be generated programmatically, batch-processed from a CSV, or extended with custom React components.

Twick takes a different approach — a video editor SDK that uses Canvas API rendering with built-in auto-captions and serverless MP4 export. Standalone, less configuration, no Remotion dependency.

**How it connects to Vanta:** The `video-editor.ts` integration provides a project format that bridges the editor UI and Remotion's renderer. Create a project in the editor, export it, and render it — or build projects programmatically with `createEditor()` and feed them into the same pipeline.

```typescript
import { createEditor, projectToRemotionProps } from "./integrations/video-editor";

const editor = createEditor({ width: 1920, height: 1080, fps: 30 });
// Add tracks programmatically or via the visual editor
const props = projectToRemotionProps(editor);
// Feed props into Remotion <Composition> for rendering
```

**What it replaces:** Remotion Pro Editor Starter ($600), CapCut Pro ($7.99/mo), Canva Pro video editor ($13/mo)

**Repos:**
- [react-video-editor](https://github.com/openvideodev/react-video-editor) — 1,700+ stars, built on Remotion (⚠️ relicensed 2026: free for individuals/small teams, paid for larger companies — pattern reference, not vendored)
- [OpenCut](https://github.com/OpenCut-app/OpenCut) — 78,700+ stars, MIT, the open-source CapCut alternative — richest timeline UX in open source
- [omniclip](https://github.com/omni-media/omniclip) — 1,400+ stars, MIT, WebCodecs browser editor
- [twick](https://github.com/ncounterspecialist/twick) — Canvas timeline SDK (⚠️ Sustainable Use License, not open source — inspiration only)

### Animated Captions — Styled Caption Rendering

**What it does:** TikTok-style word-by-word highlights, karaoke scrolls, pop-in effects, typewriter reveals. This is the visual presentation layer on top of the Whisper transcription from `auto-captions.ts`. The part Remotion Pro charges $100 for.

**How it works:** Remotion-subtitles takes your SRT/word timestamps and renders them as animated React components with pre-built caption templates. Each word is a positioned element with frame-accurate timing powered by Remotion's `interpolate()`. The active word gets scale, color, and glow effects while surrounding words dim — the exact effect you see on TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts.

Vidstack Captions (~5KB) handles format parsing — VTT, SRT, SSA — if you need to work with existing subtitle files. Vista automates the full pipeline from audio to animated captions using AssemblyAI + ffmpeg-wasm.

**How it connects to Vanta:** The `animated-captions.ts` integration takes word timestamps from `auto-captions.ts` and provides style presets (TikTok, YouTube, Reels, Karaoke) plus helper functions for determining which word is active, which words are visible, and what CSS styles to apply at each frame.

```typescript
import { transcribe } from "./integrations/auto-captions";
import { getActiveWordIndex, CAPTION_PRESETS } from "./integrations/animated-captions";

const captions = await transcribe("./audio.wav");
const currentTime = frame / fps;
const activeWord = getActiveWordIndex(captions.segments[0].words, currentTime);
const style = CAPTION_PRESETS.tiktok; // or youtube, reels, karaoke
```

**What it replaces:** Remotion Pro Animated Captions ($100), Captions app ($10/mo), CapCut auto-captions

**Repos:**
- [remotion-subtitles](https://github.com/ahgsql/remotion-subtitles) — Animated subtitles for Remotion
- [vista](https://github.com/zernonia/vista) — Auto-generate animated subtitles
- [captions](https://github.com/vidstack/captions) — 130+ stars, lightweight parser/renderer

---

### Timeline — React Timeline Editor

**What it does:** A video editing timeline component with drag-and-drop tracks, clip trimming, split/join, keyframe editing, and playhead scrubbing. Syncs with Remotion's player for real-time preview.

**How it works:** react-timeline-editor (661 stars) provides a multi-track timeline where each track holds clips (video, audio, image, text). Clips can be dragged to reposition, edges dragged to trim, and the playhead scrubbed to any point. Keyframe diamonds on clips control property animation (opacity, scale, position) over time. The timeline data exports as JSON that maps directly to Remotion `<Sequence>` components.

**How it connects to Vanta:** The `timeline.ts` integration provides a full timeline data model — create timelines, add/remove/split clips, add keyframes, and convert the whole thing to Remotion-compatible sequence data with `toRemotionSequences()`.

```typescript
import { createTimeline, addClip, toRemotionSequences } from "./integrations/timeline";

let timeline = createTimeline({ fps: 30, durationInFrames: 300 });
timeline = addClip(timeline, {
  trackIndex: 0, type: "video", src: "clip.mp4",
  startFrame: 0, endFrame: 150,
});
const sequences = toRemotionSequences(timeline);
// Each sequence maps to a Remotion <Sequence> component
```

**What it replaces:** Remotion Pro Timeline ($300)

**Repos:**
- [react-timeline-editor](https://github.com/xzdarcy/react-timeline-editor) — 770+ stars, MIT, drag-and-drop (revived — v1.0.0 shipped Jan 2026)
- [timeline-editor-react](https://github.com/kevintech/timeline-editor-react) — Lightweight (~13KB)

---

### Transitions — GL Transitions (100+ Effects)

**What it does:** GPU-accelerated video transitions — crossfade, cube rotate, pixelate, morph, kaleidoscope, glitch, film burn, and 100+ more. Each transition is a WebGL shader that runs on the GPU for instant rendering.

**How it works:** GL Transitions (1.2K+ stars) is an open collection of GLSL fragment shaders. Each shader takes two textures (outgoing scene, incoming scene) and a progress value (0→1), then blends them using the transition algorithm. A cube transition rotates the outgoing scene away like a 3D cube face revealing the incoming scene. A pixelate transition breaks the image into blocks that reform as the new scene. All of them run at 60fps because they execute on the GPU, not the CPU.

The BBC's VideoContext (1.3K+ stars) provides a higher-level composition API with shader-based transitions built in. Curtains.js (4.5K+ stars) converts DOM elements into WebGL textured planes for 3D transition effects.

**How it connects to Vanta:** The `transitions.ts` integration provides a `applyTransition()` function that returns configuration for Remotion's `<TransitionSeries>`. Choose from 30+ named transitions or pass custom GLSL shader code.

```typescript
import { applyTransition, listTransitions } from "./integrations/transitions";

// Use a named transition
const cube = applyTransition("cube", { duration: 30 });
const glitch = applyTransition("glitch", { duration: 15, intensity: 0.8 });

// See all available transitions by category
const all = listTransitions();
// { geometric: [...], "3d": [...], creative: [...], film: [...], ... }
```

**What it replaces:** Remotion Pro Cube Transition ($10) — but you get 100+ transitions instead of just one

**Repos:**
- [gl-transitions](https://github.com/gl-transitions/gl-transitions) — 1,200+ stars, 100+ WebGL shaders
- [VideoContext](https://github.com/bbc/VideoContext) — 1,300+ stars, BBC video composition
- [curtains.js](https://github.com/martinlaxenaire/curtainsjs) — 4,500+ stars, WebGL DOM transitions

---

### Motion Graphics — Shapes, Animations, Data Viz

**What it does:** SVG shapes with animation (circles, bursts, stars, blobs), path drawing effects, particle bursts, lower thirds, countdowns, confetti, progress bars — the building blocks of professional motion design. No After Effects needed.

**How it works:** This integration bridges four massive animation libraries into Remotion's frame-based rendering:

- **Motion** (30.2K+ stars, formerly Framer Motion) — React-native animations with spring physics, SVG path morphing, and layout animations. Drop Motion components directly into Remotion compositions.
- **Anime.js** (46.5K+ stars) — Lightweight engine for SVG, DOM, and JavaScript object animations. Handles complex choreography with timeline sequencing.
- **Mo.js** (18.6K+ stars) — Purpose-built for motion graphics. Pre-made shape primitives (burst, swirl, stagger) that would take hours to code from scratch.
- **GSAP** (23.2K+ stars) — Industry standard. SVG morphing (MorphSVGPlugin), draw-SVG line animations, motion paths, and stagger effects used in every major studio.

**How it connects to Vanta:** The `motion-graphics.ts` integration provides `animateShape()` for individual elements, `createBurst()` for particle effects, `animatePath()` for SVG line drawing, and pre-built templates for common motion graphics (lower thirds, countdowns, confetti, progress bars).

```typescript
import { animateShape, createBurst, TEMPLATES } from "./integrations/motion-graphics";

// Animate a shape
const circle = animateShape("circle", {
  from: { scale: 0, opacity: 0, x: 0, y: 0 },
  to: { scale: 1, opacity: 1, x: 200, y: 100 },
  duration: 30, easing: "spring",
});

// Create a confetti burst
const confetti = TEMPLATES.confetti(["#FFD700", "#FF4444", "#44FF44"]);

// Lower third title
const title = TEMPLATES.lowerThird("John Smith — CEO", "#FFD700");
```

**What it replaces:** Remotion Pro Colors and Shapes ($20), Remotion Pro Watercolor Map ($50), After Effects shape layers, Motion Array templates ($30/mo)

**Repos:**
- [motion](https://github.com/motiondivision/motion) — 30,200+ stars (Framer Motion)
- [anime.js](https://github.com/juliangarnier/anime) — 46,500+ stars
- [mo.js](https://github.com/mojs/mojs) — 18,600+ stars
- [GSAP](https://github.com/greensock/GSAP) — 23,200+ stars

### Image Editor — Sharp & JIMP

**What it does:** Programmatic image editing — resize, crop, color correct, apply filters, composite layers, batch process thousands of photos. The Photoshop and Lightroom replacement.

**How it works:** Sharp (31.8K+ stars) is the fastest image processing library in Node.js. It's backed by libvips (C++), which means operations that take Photoshop seconds take Sharp milliseconds. Resize a 4K photo in 20ms. Batch color-correct 500 images in under a minute. Apply LUT color grades, adjust exposure/contrast/saturation, sharpen, blur — everything Lightroom does, but scriptable.

JIMP (14.6K+ stars) is the pure JavaScript alternative. Zero native dependencies means it runs everywhere — browser, Node, serverless functions. It handles compositing, filters, text overlay, and format conversion without compiling anything.

Fabric.js bridges both into a visual canvas editor with layers, blend modes, and real-time preview — the Photoshop layer panel, in the browser.

**How it connects to Vanta:** The `image-editor.ts` integration provides `processImage()` for single edits, `batchProcess()` for folder-level operations, `createComposition()` for layered compositing, and 17 filter presets (cinematic, noir, chrome, warm-vintage, etc.) that apply directly to images before they enter the Remotion render pipeline.

```typescript
import { processImage, FILTER_RECIPES } from "./integrations/image-editor";

// Color grade a photo
await processImage("./photo.jpg", {
  resize: { width: 1920 },
  colorCorrect: FILTER_RECIPES.cinematic,
  sharpen: true,
  output: "./photo-graded.jpg",
});

// Use in Remotion: <Img src="./photo-graded.jpg" />
```

**What it replaces:** Adobe Photoshop ($22.99/mo), Adobe Lightroom ($9.99/mo), Canva Pro image editing ($13/mo)

**Repos:**
- [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) — 31,800+ stars, fastest Node.js image processor

### Vector Graphics — SVG.js & Paper.js

**What it does:** Create, edit, and animate vector graphics — logos, icons, illustrations, infographics, data visualizations. Export as SVG for infinite scaling or convert to PNG/WebP at any resolution.

**How it works:** SVG.js provides a clean API for building SVG documents programmatically. Instead of hand-writing XML, you call `addCircle()`, `addPath()`, `addText()` and get a valid SVG document. Paper.js adds boolean operations (union, subtract, intersect) — the core of vector illustration work that lets you combine shapes into complex forms.

SVG-Edit gives you a full browser-based editor when you need visual control. Fabric.js bridges vector and raster, letting you mix SVG elements with bitmap images on the same canvas.

**How it connects to Vanta:** The `vector-graphics.ts` integration provides document creation, shape helpers (circle, rect, path, text), gradient definitions, boolean path operations, and SVG export. The output plugs directly into Remotion as inline SVG inside `<AbsoluteFill>` components, or converts to PNG via Sharp for raster rendering.

```typescript
import { createSVG, addCircle, addText, addLinearGradient, exportSVG } from "./integrations/vector-graphics";

let doc = createSVG(1920, 1080);
doc = addLinearGradient(doc, "bg", [
  { offset: "0%", color: "#0a0a0a" },
  { offset: "100%", color: "#1a1a2e" },
], 135);
doc = addCircle(doc, { cx: 960, cy: 540, r: 200, fill: "url(#bg)", stroke: "#FFD700", strokeWidth: 2 });
doc = addText(doc, { content: "VANTA", x: 960, y: 560, fontSize: 120, fontWeight: 100, fill: "#FFFFFF" });

const svg = exportSVG(doc);
// Use in Remotion: <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: svg }} />
```

**What it replaces:** Adobe Illustrator ($22.99/mo), Figma Pro ($15/mo for full features), Canva vector tools

### Particle Effects — tsparticles

**What it does:** Adds particle systems to video scenes — confetti, fireworks, snow, floating orbs, constellation networks, smoke, custom shapes. GPU-accelerated, runs at 60fps.

**How it works:** tsparticles (8.6K+ stars) is a JavaScript particle engine that renders via Canvas or WebGL. It supports attractors, collision detection, custom shapes, image particles, and trail effects. In Vanta, particles render as React components inside Remotion compositions, so they're frame-accurate and deterministic — the same render always produces the same output.

### Audio Visualization — wavesurfer.js

**What it does:** Takes any audio file and produces real-time waveform and spectrogram visualizations. Beat-synced bars, frequency analysis, audio-reactive motion.

**How it works:** wavesurfer.js (10K+ stars) uses the Web Audio API to decode audio and extract amplitude, frequency, and time-domain data. In Vanta, this data drives visual elements in Remotion scenes — bar heights, particle velocities, color shifts, text reveals — all synced to the audio.

**Repos:**
- [wavesurfer.js](https://github.com/katspaugh/wavesurfer.js) — 10,000+ stars

## FAQ

**Is Vanta really free for commercial use?**
Yes. Vanta itself is MIT. Every default integration is audited for commercial-safe licensing (Apache-2.0 / MIT / BSD — code AND model weights). The full audit lives in [ENHANCEMENTS.md](ENHANCEMENTS.md). Note: Remotion itself requires a company license for for-profit teams of 4+ — individuals and small teams are free.

**What is Vanta an alternative to?**
Synthesia, HeyGen, and D-ID (AI avatars) · Runway ML and Pika (AI video generation) · ElevenLabs, PlayHT, and Murf (voice cloning) · Descript and Captions (auto-captions) · Suno, Udio, and Epidemic Sound (music) · CapCut Pro and Canva (video editing) · Topaz Video AI (upscaling) · Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, and Podcast (Creative Cloud) · the entire Remotion Pro Store.

**Do I need a GPU?**
For the Remotion render pipeline, captions, editing, transitions, and motion graphics — no. For local AI generation (video, voice, avatars), a consumer GPU helps: FramePack runs on 6GB VRAM, Wan 2.2's 5B model on a single RTX 4090, and Kokoro TTS runs in pure TypeScript with no GPU at all.

**Can I build a SaaS on this?**
That's the point. MIT license, commercial-safe model weights, local rendering. Charge for the videos, the platform, or both.
